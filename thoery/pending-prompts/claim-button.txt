ok now we need to work on the claim button flow for the case when daddycoin balance is not sufficient..

im thinking of a modal that motivates user to play games in daddy mode and earn daddy coins to win the prize claim.. with buttons/cards to games

but right now we only have one game tic tac toe.. but in future we'll have many games.. and "Fake Toe" game is coming soon..

so im not getting any ideas how the modal design must be
